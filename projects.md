### Comparative Analysis of Sentiment and Emotion Prediction Models in Context of Covid-19 Conspiracy Theories

This project was grounded in the cultural evolutionary theory - a theory based on Darwinian evolutionary theory, which claims that cultural information is spread according to the features, which increase their probablity of spreading. I wanted to find out whether negative Tweets will spread better, and also, compare classic and more modern sentiment and emotion analysis methods.

For sentiment analysis, I used VADER, Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis from Hugging Face, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa. For emotion analysis - NRCLex, Emotion English DistilroBERTa-base from HuggingFace and a fine-tuned RoBERTa

There were fewer conspiracy tweets and they were more negative.
